# HCP-Behaviour

The curated dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), provided by NeuroMatch Academy (NMA), includes preprocessed fMRI time series aggregated across 360 regions of interest (ROIs). To access the dataset, users must electronically sign the HCP data usage terms in ConnectomeDB (instructions are detailed on pages 24â€“25 of the HCP Reference Manual). NMA provides code for basic data downloading, visualization, and processing.

This dataset allows analysis of fMRI data from tasks like EMOTION, SOCIAL, and LANGUAGE, exploring brain activations in 360 ROIs and their relationships with individual variables such as life satisfaction (LifeSatisf_Unadj), sleep quality (PSQI_Score), and fear perception (FearAffect_Unadj). Using models like LSTM and LNN, key functional networks (e.g., Somatomotor, Visual, Ventral Multimodal, Default Mode) were analyzed, revealing hemispheric differences and their roles in emotional regulation, multisensory integration, and language processing.

Key findings include:  
- Functional connectivity matrices and Louvain clustering uncovered hierarchical brain organization and interactions during tasks.  
- Tasks are designed to activate specific brain networks:
  - **EMOTION**: Contrasts fearful and neutral faces, assessing emotional processing.
  - **SOCIAL**: Examines brain activity during complex social scenarios versus random stimuli.
  - **LANGUAGE**: Explores verbal and mathematical processing in linguistic and problem-solving regions.  
- Individual factors like life satisfaction, sleep quality, and fear perception provide insights into cognitive and emotional modulation.

This analysis highlights how individual differences influence brain network interactions and their importance for applications in neuroscience and mental health.
